Additionally, you must comply with the minimum age stipulations mandated by the laws of your residing country.
If you are under the age of 18, you must have the permission of your parent or legal guardian to use Omnis.

## **Premium Features and OpenAI Credits**

If users exceed their credit allowance, prompt and image generation will be temporarily disabled until the next billing cycle or until the pledge amount is increased.
Credit usage is reset at the beginning of each billing cycle, and any remaining credits do not carry over to the next month.
Users are encouraged to monitor their credit usage to avoid any disruptions in service.

## **Privacy and Data Handling**
The Developer prioritizes user privacy and does not collect any personal information for marketing or advertising purposes.
Conversations are stored in memory temporarily and are cleared after two minutes of inactivity.
These conversations are used in conjunction with OpenAI for generating responses.
Once a conversation is cleared from memory, it can no longer be accessed by Omnis.
Omnis does not log any message content or use it for training AI models.
Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/">OpenAI's privacy policy</a> to learn how they handle message content sent to them through Omnis.

Omnis utilizes Google's Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to provide its TTS functionalities and Google's Speech-to-Text (STT) technology for it's voice command features.
Importantly, by default, Google does not log customer audio data or transcripts as seen in their [Data logging doc](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/data-logging), and Omnis also adheres to this practice, ensuring that your audio interactions remain private and secure.
Omnis is not set to opt-in to Google's data logging program, and your voice data is not stored or logged by either Google or Omnis, allowing you to use these features with confidence in the protection of your privacy.

For users with a premium membership, user settings are stored and linked to a Discord User ID (also known as a Snowflake), which is an 18-digit number unique to each user.
This number is solely used for storing user settings and is not utilized for identifying, profiling, or monitoring users in any way.
The developer is committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of your information.
Premium users also gain access to Porcupine Wake Word Detection from Picovoice to wake Omnis up in a voice channel by saying it's name.
[Picovoice's privacy policy](https://picovoice.ai/docs/privacy-policy/#:~:text=No%20audio%20data%20generated%20using,unless%20otherwise%20requested%20or%20specified.) states that no audio data is tracked, stored, or reviewed by Picovoice or any other third party to improve Picovoice Services or Software unless otherwise requested or specified.
