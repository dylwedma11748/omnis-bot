You'll receive an allowance every month based on the amount that you pledge. If you use more than your allowance covers, you'll temporarily lose access to prompt generation until your usage resets when your membership renews or until you increase your pledge.</p> How many servers can I use my membership in? <p>You can use your membership in any server with Omnis. You do not need multiple subscriptions for additional servers.</p> Can I share my membership with other users? <p>Not at the moment, but I do have plans to add a membership tier that lets you do just that.</p> How do I receive my benefits? <p>All you need to do link your Discord account and Patreon account.</p> I've linked my accounts/increased my pledge, but still haven't recieved my benefits. What's going on? <p>Omnis refreshes it's Patreon subscriptions every 60 seconds. If you still aren't recieving your benefits after that, then Patreon's servers may be under maintenance.
